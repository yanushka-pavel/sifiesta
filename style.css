/*The mask is anchored at C (at 0% 100%).

0deg starts along the positive X direction from C → towards D.

The wedge 0° to 90° is fully opaque (black) → slide visible here.

At 90° the mask suddenly becomes transparent, so anything beyond the diagonal toward A disappears.

Visually:

Start angle = 0°: The visible area is along C → D (bottom edge).

As it grows to 90°: The visible wedge sweeps C → D → B (right edge).

At exactly 90°: Everything up to C → B diagonal is visible.

Past 90°: Nothing new is visible (the rest of the square stays masked out).

So you can imagine it like a rotating triangular “page reveal” with its pivot at C (bottom-left).*/
